/**
 * Depth First Search Algo is an uninformed graph traversal algorithm
 * which produces a non-optimal solution 
 * but can be useful for traversing quickly into deeper search domains
 * 
 * in that algorithm you start at the top most node in a tree and then
 * follow the left most branch until there exists no more leafs in that branch
 *
